# Bike Sales Analysis

### Project Description
The project involves analyzing a dataset of bike sales to gain insights into customer demographics and their purchasing patterns. The dataset contains information about each customer, including their marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, and occupation.

### Key Objectives
Understand the relationship between customer demographics and bike purchases
Identify the most influential factors that drive bike sales
Segment customers based on their characteristics and buying behavior
Develop targeted marketing strategies to attract potential customers

### Data Overview
The dataset provided is an Excel file named "Bike_Sales.xlsx" with the following columns:
- Marital Status: Married (M) or Single (S)
- Gender: Male (M) or Female (F)
- Income: Annual income in dollars
- Children: Number of children
- Education: Highest level of education attained
- Occupation: Type of occupation

### Insights
#### Demographic Trends
- Middle-aged customers (31–60 years) have the highest bike purchase rate (~60% conversion).
- Adolescents show the lowest purchase rate (~35%), followed by older customers (~46%).
- Males generally have higher average incomes and a greater bike purchase rate than females.
- Overall, purchasers have higher average incomes than non-purchasers.

#### Commute Distance Impact
- Customers with 0–1 mile commute have the highest number of bike purchases.
- Purchases decline as commute distance increases, but there’s still notable interest at 5–10 miles.

#### Education & Occupation Influence
- Customers with Bachelor’s or Graduate Degrees in professional or skilled occupations are more likely to buy bikes.
- Professional and management roles show stronger purchasing intent compared to manual and clerical jobs.

#### Marital & Home Ownership Factors
- Married professionals are slightly more likely to purchase than singles.
- Homeowners have a higher buying tendency than renters.

#### Overall Dataset Stats
- Total records: 462
- Total purchases: 250
- Overall conversion rate: ~54%

#### Actionable Recommendations
- Focus marketing on middle-aged professionals with higher income.
- Promote bike models optimized for short-distance commuting.
- Target campaigns by education level and professional status.

### Next Steps
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing values or inconsistencies
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data
- Apply statistical techniques to determine the significance of each demographic factor on bike sales
- Segment customers using clustering algorithms based on their characteristics


By following these steps and leveraging the insights gained from the data, the project aims to provide valuable recommendations for improving bike sales and customer engagement.
